          Python Astrometric Orbit Fitting  
        ------------------------------------
        
        PyAstrOFit is a package dedicated to orbital fit within the
        MCMC approach, written in Python 2.7. The MCMC sampler makes
        direct use of emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013).
        
        PyAstrOFit is being developed within the VORTEX team @ University of Liege (Belgium).
        It's still a work in progress. If you want to report a bug, suggest a feature or add a 
        feature please contact the main developer at owertz [at] ulg.ac.be or through 
        github.
        
        
        QUICK INSTRUCTIONS
        ==================
        From the root of the PyAstrOFit package:
        $ python setup.py install
        
        Or if you want to keep the trace off all installed file:
        $ python setup.py install â€”-record files.txt
        
        Therefore, if you want to uninstall the package, just do:
        $ cat files.txt | xargs rm -rf
        
        
        DEPENDENCIES
        ============
        You must have a python distribution installed (e.g. Canopy, Anaconda, MacPorts),
        that will allow easy and robust package management and avoid messing up with the 
        system default python. I recommend using Anaconda over Canopy or MacPorts. 
        
        The PyAstrOFit package depends on existing packages from the Standard Library
        and specific ones as well, e.g.:
        
        numpy
        matplotlib
        astropy
